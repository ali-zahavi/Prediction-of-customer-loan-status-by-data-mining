# Prediction-of-customer-loan-status-by-data-mining
It is a classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan would be approved or not. In a classification problem, we have to predict discrete values based on a given set of independent variable(s). Classification can be of two types:

Binary Classification : In this classification we have to predict either of the two given classes. For example: classifying the gender as male or female, predicting the result as win or loss, etc.

Multiclass Classification : Here we have to classify the data into three or more classes. For example: classifying a movie's genre as comedy, action or romantic, classify fruits as oranges, apples, or pears, etc.

Loan prediction is a very common real-life problem that each retail bank faces atleast once in its lifetime. If done correctly, it can save a lot of man hours at the end of a retail bank.

What is hypothesis generation?

This is a very important stage in any data science/machine learning pipeline. It involves understanding the problem in detail by brainstorming as many factors as possible which can impact the outcome. It is done by understanding the problem statement thoroughly and before looking at the data.

Below are some of the factors which I think can affect the Loan Approval (dependent variable for this loan prediction problem):

Salary: Applicants with high income should have more chances of loan approval.

Previous history: Applicants who have repayed their previous debts should have higher chances of loan approval.

Loan amount: Loan approval should also depend on the loan amount. If the loan amount is less, chances of loan approval should be high.

Loan term: Loan for less time period and less amount should have higher chances of approval.

EMI: Lesser the amount to be paid monthly to repay the loan, higher the chances of loan approval.
